# Project-2
Contains the Red Team vs Blue Team project for Monash Cybersecurity boot camp

Unit Description
In the second project week, you will work on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which you will play the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, you will attack a vulnerable VM within your environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, you will use Kibana to review logs taken during their Day 1 engagement. You'll use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report.
Then, you will interpret your log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that you've successfully performed.

Unit Objectives

This week's project will prompt you to apply knowledge of the following skills and tools:


Penetration testing with Kali Linux.
Log and incident analysis with Kibana.
System hardening and configuration.
Reporting, documentation, and communication.


Lab Environment
